# Augmentation Methods for Data Augmentation

This project provides various data augmentation methods for text data. The augmentation methods are implemented in `augment.py`, and the `runner.py` script demonstrates how to use these methods. We use this to augmentate the dataset of Bahnarist and Vietnamese. But evey language is alright to use.

## Augmentation Methods

### 1. Combine
Combines sentences from the dataset in pairs to create new sentences.

### 2. SwapSentences
Swaps sentences within the same text to create new variations.

### 3. ReplaceWithSameType
Replaces words in the sentences with other words of the same type from a dictionary.

### 4. RandomInsertion
Randomly inserts words from a dictionary into the sentences.

### 5. RandomDeletion
Randomly deletes words from the sentences.

### 6. SlidingWindows
Generates new sentences by applying a sliding window over the original sentences.

## Configuration

The configuration for the augmentation methods is defined at the beginning of `augment.py`:

- `LANG_SOURCE`: Source language code (e.g., 'tiếng bana' for Bahnarist).
- `LANG_TARGET`: Target language code (e.g., 'tiếng việt' for Vietnamese).
- `INPUT_PATH`: Path to the input CSV file containing the sentences.
- `DICTIONARY_PATH`: Path to the dictionary CSV file.
- `LIMIT_NEW_SENTENCES`: Limit for new sentences generated by `ReplaceWithSameType`.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for the `Combine` method.
- `NUM_INSERTIONS`: Number of insertions for `RandomInsertion`.
- `MAX_LINES_GENERATED`: Maximum lines generated by `RandomInsertion`.
- `NUM_DELETIONS`: Number of deletions for `RandomDeletion`.
- `WINDOW_SIZE`: Window size for `SlidingWindows`.

## Usage

To run the augmentation methods, execute the `runner.py` script:

```bash
python runner.py
```

The script will generate augmented data and save the results to the `output` directory.

## Output

The output files are saved in the `output` directory with the following names:

- `combined.csv`: Output from the `Combine` method.
- `swapped_sentences.csv`: Output from the `SwapSentences` method.
- `replaced_with_same_type.csv`: Output from the `ReplaceWithSameType` method.
- `random_insertion.csv`: Output from the `RandomInsertion` method.
- `random_deletion.csv`: Output from the `RandomDeletion` method.
- `sliding_windows.csv`: Output from the `SlidingWindows` method.

## Dependencies
Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
