# Augmentation Methods for Data Augmentation

This project provides various data augmentation methods for text data. The augmentation methods are implemented in `augment.py`, and the `runner.py` script demonstrates how to use these methods. We use this to augmentate the dataset of Bahnarist and Vietnamese. But every language is alright to use.

## Getting started
Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Augmentation Methods
### 1. Combine sentences
Combines sentences from the dataset in pairs to create new sentences.

### 2. Swap sentences
Swaps sentences within the same text to create new variations.

### 3. Replace words with the same types of word
Replaces words in the sentences with other words of the same type from a dictionary.

### 4. Random Insertion
Randomly inserts words from a dictionary into the sentences.

### 5. Random Deletion
Randomly deletes words from the sentences.

### 6. Sliding Window
Generates new sentences by applying a sliding window over the original sentences, starting from a custom value until the maximum possible window.

## Configuration and running

The configuration for the augmentation methods is defined at the beginning of `runner.py` in the configuration zone:

- `LANG_SOURCE`: Source language code (e.g., 'tiếng bana' for Bahnarist).
- `LANG_TARGET`: Target language code (e.g., 'tiếng việt' for Vietnamese).
- `INPUT_PATH`: Path to the input CSV file containing the sentences.
- `DICTIONARY_PATH`: Path to the dictionary CSV file.
- `LIMIT_NEW_SENTENCES`: Limit for new sentences generated by `ReplaceWithSameType`.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for the `Combine` method.
- `NUM_INSERTIONS`: Number of insertions for `RandomInsertion`.
- `MAX_LINES_GENERATED`: Maximum lines generated by `RandomInsertion`.
- `NUM_DELETIONS`: Number of deletions for `RandomDeletion`.
- `WINDOW_SIZE`: Window size for `SlidingWindows`.
- `METHOD_NUMS`: Select the augmentation method to run:
  - `1`: Combine sentences
  - `2`: Sentence-level swapping
  - `3`: Replace words
  - `4`: Random Insertion
  - `5`: Random Deletion
  - `6`: Sliding Window

To run the augmentation methods, execute the `runner.py` script:

```bash
python runner.py
```

Set the `METHOD_NUMS` value in `runner.py` to select the desired augmentation method before running the script.

The script will generate augmented data and save the results to the `output` directory.
