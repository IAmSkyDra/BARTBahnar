# Augmentation Methods for Data Augmentation

This project offers a collection of data augmentation techniques tailored for text data. All augmentation methods are implemented in `augment.py`, while `runner.py` serves as a usage example, demonstrating how to apply these techniques effectively. Although our primary use case involves augmenting datasets in Bahnaric and Vietnamese, the framework is language-agnostic and can be applied to various language.

## Augmentation Methods

### 1. CombineSentences
Combines sentences from the dataset in pairs to create new sentences.

### 2. SwapSentences
Swaps sentences within the same papagraph to create new variations.

### 3. ReplaceWithSameThemes
Replaces words in the sentences with other words of the same thematic labels from a dictionary such as humna, animal, food, occupations, location,v.v.

### 4. ReplaceWithSameSynonyms
Replace words with similar *part-of-speech* (POS) tags to improve sentence semantics.


### 5. RandomInsertion
Randomly inserts words before the ending word with the words having similarity in themetic labels (location and time reference). 

### 6. RandomDeletion
Randomly deletes words from the sentences.

### 7. SlidingWindows
Generates new sentences by applying a sliding window, with a size ranging from two to less than the length of the sentence, over the original sentences.
## Configuration

The configuration for the augmentation methods is defined at the beginning of `augment.py`:

- `LANG_SOURCE`: Source language code (e.g., 'tiếng bana' for Bahnarist).
- `LANG_TARGET`: Target language code (e.g., 'tiếng việt' for Vietnamese).
- `INPUT_PATH`: Path to the input CSV file containing the sentences.
- `DICTIONARY_PATH`: Path to the dictionary CSV file.
- `LIMIT_NEW_SENTENCES`: Limit for new sentences generated by `ReplaceWithSameType`.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for the `Combine` method.
- `NUM_INSERTIONS`: Number of insertions for `RandomInsertion`.
- `MAX_LINES_GENERATED`: Maximum lines generated by `RandomInsertion`.
- `NUM_DELETIONS`: Number of deletions for `RandomDeletion`.
- `WINDOW_SIZE`: Window size for `SlidingWindows`.

## Usage

To run the augmentation methods, execute the `runner.py` script:

```bash
python runner.py
```

The script will generate augmented data and save the results to the `output` directory.

## Dependencies
Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
