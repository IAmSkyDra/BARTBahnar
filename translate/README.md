# Bahnaric - Vietnamese Translator

Bahnaric-Vietnamese Translator is a sentence translation tool that follows a **Hybrid NMT Architecture**, integrating multiple **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** to enhance translation accuracy and fluency.  
The system leverages **Loanword Detection, Word Segmentation, Lexical Mapping with Solr, and BART-based translation** to handle phrases that cannot be directly translated using a dictionary.

## Translation Flow

1. **Loanword Detection & Removal**

    - Uses **Underthesea** and a **Vietnamese dictionary** to detect and extract borrowed words from Vietnamese, including:
        - **Named Entities** (e.g., "Binh Minh", "Da Nang")
        - **Numerical Values** (e.g., "50", "2", "500")
        - **Punctuation** (e.g., "%", ",", ".", etc.)
    - Detected loanwords are then processed separately.

2. **Word Segmentation** Applies **PMI-based (Pointwise Mutual Information) word segmentation** to split the sentence into meaningful word units.

3. **Lexical Mapping with Solr** Uses the **Bahnaric-Vietnamese bilingual dictionary** powered by Solr to find possible translations.

4. **Fallback to BARTBahnar** If certain words or phrases are not found in the dictionary, the system applies **BARTBahnar**, a BART-based translation model, to process the remaining text.

5. **Post-Processing** Reconstructs the translated words into a well-formed Vietnamese sentence while maintaining grammatical correctness.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAmSkyDra/BARTBahnar.git
cd translate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Before running the script, ensure the required files are correctly set up in the configuration.

### **Modify Paths in `config.py`**

Update the following paths to match your directory structure if needed:

```python
DICTIONARY_PATH = "../data/dictionary/bahnaric.csv"
WORD_PATH = "../data/corpus/vietnamese_words.csv"
CORPUS = "../data/corpus/corpus_bahnaric.txt"
```

### **Explanation of Each File**

-   `DICTIONARY_PATH`: Path to the Bahnaric-Vietnamese dictionary, used for lexical mapping.
-   `WORD_PATH`: A dictionary of known Vietnamese words, used in loanword detection and classification.
-   `CORPUS`: A Bahnaric text corpus, used for word segmentation to improve translation accuracy.

---

## Usage

### Run the script:

```bash
python main.py --translator_model "your_custom_model" --classification_model "your_ner_model" --solr_url "http://your-solr-url"
```

Example:

```bash
python main.py --translator_model "IAmSkyDra/BARTBana_Translation" --classification_model "undertheseanlp/vietnamese-ner-v1.4.0a2" --best_candidate_model "NlpHUST/gpt2-vietnamese" --solr_url "http://localhost:8983/solr/mycore"
```

-   The **BARTBana translation model** can be retrieved from: **[BARTBana Model Download](#insert-bartbana-model-url-here)**
-   Refer to the [Apache Solr Setup Guide (Windows)](#apache-solr-setup-guide-windows) for instructions on setting up Solr and obtaining the solr_url.

If you want to use the default models, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Translate a sentence interactively:

Once the script starts, **you can enter sentences continuously**:

```plaintext
Enter a sentence to translate: S√¥ No√¢ng nghie√¢p oe√™ng p√¥jing cham p√¥lei √¥√™i t√¥drong to√¢ng h√¥√™p, p√¥tho khan UBND tinh, ‚ÄòBo√¢ No√¢ng nghie√¢p oe√™ng p√¥jing cham p√¥lei adrol ‚Äòna√™r ‚Äòba√™l ji√™t p√¥√±a√™m rim khe√™i (k√¥dih khe√™i minh ji√™t ‚Äòba√™l g√∂i ‚Äòba√™o ka√™o adrol ‚Äòna√™r minh ji√™t) oe√™ng p√¥tho khan √±o√¢t xua√¢t j√¥nang √¥√™i t√¥drong wa√™.

Enter a sentence to translate: exit
Exiting the program. See you next time!
```

## Notes

-   Use **Ctrl + C** to force stop the script anytime.
-   Ensure **Solr** is running.
-   It is **recommended to create a separate Solr core** for this script, as it **will delete all data in the specified core** before processing.

# Apache Solr Setup Guide (Windows)

## 1. Download & Install Solr

1. Download the latest Solr version from:  
   [https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html](https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html)

2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a preferred location.

3. Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and navigate to the Solr folder:
    ```sh
    cd path\to\solr-9.x.x\bin
    ```

## 2. Start Solr

Run the following command to start Solr in standalone mode:

```sh
solr start
```

By default, Solr runs on **port 8983**.

## 3. Access Solr Admin Panel

Once Solr is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8983/solr
```

This is the **Solr URL** where you can manage collections and query data.

## 4. Create a Core in Solr

Before indexing data, you need to create a core. Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and run:

```sh
solr create -c mycore
```

-   Replace `mycore` with your desired core name.

After creation, you can see your core in the **Solr Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:8983/solr](http://localhost:8983/solr)

## 5. Get Core URL for API Use

Once the core is created, you can access it using:

```
http://localhost:8983/solr/mycore
```

Replace `mycore` with your actual core name.

**_This URL serves as the `solr_url` parameter in the script, allowing the program to interact with the Solr core for querying and indexing data._**

### Example: Query all data in the core

```
http://localhost:8983/solr/mycore/select?q=*
```

## 6. Stop Solr

To stop Solr, use:

```sh
solr stop
```
